# Backend Study

This repository will store the projects and coursework that I do on MOOC websites like Coursera and Udacity.  I have an interest in web applications but because I don't get to work with these technologies professionally I have to learn them on my own.

## Completed Courses

Much of the content of these courses is review for me so I was able to breeze through courses quickly:

  1. [Intro to Backend](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-backend--ud171)
  2. [Intro to Relation Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197)
  3. [Fullstack Foundations](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088)
