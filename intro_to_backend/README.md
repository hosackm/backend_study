# Intro to Backend

This course if offered for free on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-backend--ud171).  It is expected that the course should take 3 weeks to complete but since most of it was review I finished in 3 days.

## Things I learned

  * I had never seen the form POST redirect strategy that repopulates a form after invalid entries are detected
  * I had never used cookies to persist a user's login
  * I had minimal exposure to password hashing and had only heard of sha256 etc. but never used them in practice
  * I had only heard of salting password but never seen how it works
  * I had not used sqlite before. Also I had never used the python sqlite3 module
